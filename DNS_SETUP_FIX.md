# ðŸ”§ DNS Setup Fix for softwarevalalib.app

## The Error

```
Both softwarevalalib.app and its alternate name are improperly configured
Domain does not resolve to the GitHub Pages server.
```

## Cause

The DNS records haven't been properly configured or haven't propagated yet. DNS changes can take 24-48 hours.

---

## Solution: Proper DNS Configuration

### Step 1: Configure DNS in Namecheap

1. Login to **Namecheap**
2. Go to **Domain List** â†’ Click **Manage** for **softwarevalalib.app**
3. Go to **Advanced DNS** tab
4. **Delete** any existing A records for @ and www

### Step 2: Add Correct Records

Add these DNS records **exactly** as shown:

| Type | Host | Value | TTL |
|------|------|-------|-----|
| **A Record** | @ | 185.199.108.153 | Automatic |
| **A Record** | @ | 185.å—·199.109.153 | Automatic |
| **A Record** | @ | 185.199.110.153 | Automatic |
| **A Record** | @ | 185.199.111.153 | Automatic |
| **CNAME Record** | www | samsonbryant.github.io | Automatic |

**Important**: You need **ALL 4 A records** for the root domain (@).

### Step 3: Check Your Current DNS

Visit: https://dnschecker.org/#A/softwarevalalib.app

Make sure all 4 A records are showing up globally.

### Step 4: Verify in GitHub

1. Go to: https://github.com/samsonbryant/softwarevalalib/settings/pages
2. Under "Custom domain", make sure it shows: **softwarevalalib.app**
3. Click **Save** even if it's already there

## Alternative: Use Only GitHub Pages URL

If DNS continues to be problematic, you can use:

**https://samsonbryant.github.io/softwarevalalib**

This URL works immediately and is perfectly fine for your business. Many companies use GitHub Pages URLs.

### Pros of GitHub URL:
- âœ… Works immediately
- âœ… Free SSL certificate
- âœ… Reliable hosting
- âœ… No DNS configuration needed
- âœ… Easy to remember

### Update Your Marketing Materials

Use these URLs:
- Website: https://samsonbryant.github.io/softwarevalalib
- Email signature links
- Business cards
- Social media profiles

## Check DNS Status

### After Adding DNS Records:

1. Wait **24-48 hours** for propagation
2. Check DNS: https://dnschecker.org/#A390/softwarevalalib.app
3. All locations should show 4 A records
4. Once green everywhere, SSL certificate will activate automatically

### If Still Not Working After 48 Hours:

1. Double-check all 4 A records are added
2. Verify CNAME for www points to samsonbryant.github.io
3. Contact Namecheap support
4. Consider using only the GitHub URL

## Quick Check Commands

Test if DNS is working:

```bash
# Check A records
dig softwarevalalib.app +short

# Should show 4 IP addresses:
# 185.199.108.153
# 185.199.109.153
# 185.199.110.153
# 185.199.111.153
```

## Recommendation

**For now, use the GitHub Pages URL** until DNS fully propagates:

**https://samsonbryant.github.io/softwarevalalib**

Your website is fully functional at this URL, and you can always switch to the custom domain later once DNS is properly configured and propagated.
