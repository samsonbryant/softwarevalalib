# Services Display Issue - RESOLVED ✅

## Problem Identified
Services were not showing on the website due to **visibility state management** issues.

## Root Causes:
1. **Initial visibility state**: `isVisible` was initialized as `false`
2. **IntersectionObserver delay**: Services only became visible when scrolled into view
3. **Opacity control**: With `opacity: 0`, services were invisible until intersection occurred

## Solutions Applied:

### 1. Fixed Initial Visibility State
**Changed from:**
```javascript
const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(false);
```

**Changed to:**
```javascript
const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(true); // Start as visible
```

### 2. Removed Conditional Opacity from Service Cards
**Before:**
```javascript
opacity: isVisible ? 1 : 0,
transform: isVisible ? 'translateY(0)' : 'translateY(50px)'
```

**After:**
```javascript
opacity: 1,
transform: activeService === index ? 'translateY(-10px) scale(1.02)' : 'translateY(0)'
```

### 3. Removed Conditional Visibility from Section Header
**Before:**
```javascript
transform: isVisible ? 'translateY(0)' : 'translateY(30px)',
opacity: isVisible ? 1 : 0
```

**After:**
```javascript
transform: 'translateY(0)',
opacity: 1
```

### 4. Added Fallback for Empty Data
Added conditional check to ensure services array is loaded:
```javascript
{servicesData && servicesData.length > 0 ? servicesData.map(...) : <NoServicesMessage />}
```

### 5. Simplified Transitions
Removed complex transition delays that could cause rendering issues:
```javascript
transition: `all 0.3s ease` // Simplified from complex delays
```

## Result:
✅ **Services now display immediately** when page loads  
✅ **No scrolling required** to see services  
✅ **All 10 services visible** with proper icons  
✅ **Interactive hover effects** still work  
✅ **Responsive grid layout** maintained
