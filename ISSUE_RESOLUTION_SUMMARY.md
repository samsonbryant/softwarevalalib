# Issue Resolution Summary

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. Services Display Issue - FIXED
**Problem**: Services were not showing on the website.

**Root Cause**: The Services component was checking for specific icon strings (like 'CodeBracketIcon') instead of directly displaying the emoji icons.

**Solution**: 
- Updated the icon rendering logic to directly display the icon from the data: `{service.icon || '💼'}`
- All 10 services now display correctly with their respective icons

**Services Now Displaying**:
1. 💻 Software Development
2. 🌐 Web Development
3. ☁️ Web Hosting
4. ☁️ Cloud Services
5. 🔗 Network Infrastructure
6. 📱 Digital Marketing
7. 🎓 Training and Support
8. 🔒 Cybersecurity Services
9. 📹 CCTV Installation
10. 🎨 Graphic Design
