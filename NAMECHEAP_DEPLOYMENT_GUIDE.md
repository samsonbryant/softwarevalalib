## softwarevalalib.app

### Prerequisites
- Domain purchased: **softwarevalalib.app**
- Namecheap hosting account with cPanel access
- SSL certificate ready to install
- All website files are in the `build` folder

---

## Step 1: Prepare Your Files

All files have been built and are ready in the `build` folder. The build includes:
- âœ… Optimized production files
- âœ… `.htaccess` configuration for React Router
- âœ… Security headers and compression
- âœ… Browser caching rules

**Location**: `/Users/user/Desktop/softwarevalaliberia/build/`

---

## Step 2: Access cPanel

1. Log in to your **Namecheap account**
2. Go to **Dashboard** â†’ **Hosting List**
3. Click on **Manage** next to your hosting plan
4. Click **cPanel** button (or login directly at: `your-domain.com:2083`)

---

## Step 3: Upload Files via File Manager

### Option A: File Manager (Recommended for beginners)

1. In cPanel, click **File Manager**
2. Navigate to **public_html** folder
3. **Delete** all existing files in public_html (if any)
4. Click **Upload** button
5. Select all files from your `build` folder:
   - `index.html`
   - `static/` folder
   - `.htaccess`
6. Wait for upload to complete (may take a few minutes)

### Option B: FTP Upload (Faster for large files)

1. In cPanel, find your **FTP credentials**:
   - Host: `ftp.your-domain.com`
   - Username: (provided in cPanel)
   - Password: (your FTP password)

2. Use FTP client (FileZilla, Cyberduck, or terminal):
   ```bash
   ftp ftp.your-domain.com
   # Enter username and password
   cd public_html
   # Delete existing files
   rm *
   # Upload build folder contents
   put index.html
   mkdir static
   cd static
   # Upload static folder contents...
   ```

## Step 4: Install SSL Certificate

1. In cPanel, go to **SSL/TLS** section
2. Click **Install and Manage SSL for your site (HTTPS)**
3. Select your domain: **softwarevalalib.app**
4. Choose one of these options:

### Option A: Free Let's Encrypt SSL
1. Select **Let's Encrypt** tab
2. Click **Install** (auto-configured)
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for activation

### Option B: Manual SSL Upload
1. Select **Upload a New Certificate** tab
2. Paste your certificate files:
   - **Certificate** (CRT file)
   - **Private Key** (KEY file)
   - **Certificate Authority Bundle** (CA Bundle/Bundle)
3. Click **Install Certificate**

### Force HTTPS Redirect
After SSL is installed, uncomment this section in `.htaccess`:
```apache
# Force HTTPS (uncomment after SSL is installed)
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_Ð³Ñ€Ð°Ð¹ URI} [L,R=301]
</IfModule>
```

## Step 5: Configure Domain DNS

1. In Namecheap account, go to **Domain List**
2. Click **Manage** next to **softwarevalalib.app**
3. Go to **Advanced DNS** tab

### A-Record Configuration
Add or update these records:

| Type | Host | Value | TTL |
|------|------|-------|-----|
| **A Record** | @ | Your hosting IP address | Automatic |
| **A Record** | www | Your hosting IP address | Automatic |
| **CNAME** | www | softwarevalalib.app | Automatic |

**Your hosting IP address** can be found in cPanel â†’ **IP Address** or contact Namecheap support.

## Step 6: Wait for DNS Propagation

- DNS changes typically take **24-48 hours** to fully propagate
- Check status at: https://dnschecker.org/#A/softwarevalalib.app
- Once complete, your site will be accessible at:
  - https://softwarevalalib.app
  - https://www.softwarevalalib.app

---

## Step 7: Test Your Website

### Basic Tests
1. âœ… Visit https://softwarevalalib.app
2. âœ… Check all pages load correctly (Home, Services, Projects, About, Contact)
3. âœ… Verify navigation works properly
4. âœ… Test forms and interactive elements
5. âœ… Check SSL certificate (browser should show padlock)

### React Router Test
Try direct URLs:
- https://softwarevalalib.app/services
- https://softwarevalalib.app/about
- https://softwarevalalib.app/contact

All should load without 404 errors.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: 404 Error on Routes
**Solution**: Make sure `.htaccess` file is uploaded and readable. Check file permissions (should be 644).

### Issue: SSL Not Working
**Solution**: 
- Wait 10-15 minutes after installation
- Clear browser cache
- Use https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/ to check SSL status

### Issue: Site Shows Default Page
**Solution**: Make sure files were uploaded to `public_html` (not a subfolder)

### Issue: CSS/JS Not Loading
**Solution**: 
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `static` folder uploaded correctly
- Check file paths in `index.html`
